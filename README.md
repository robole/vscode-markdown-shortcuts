Keyboard shortcuts for markdown snippets.

![example](/img/example.gif)

The cool thing about snippets is that they can be setup to behave like a wizard and give a guided editing experience. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the example above, when you insert a task list, you can tab through each task completing them as you go. For each task, first you are given options to check/uncheck (x or blank) that task, then you can enter the title. If you don't want to edit the snippet at all, or you are done early, just hit `Enter` and the snippet will be finalised. Easy-peasy! üôå

The snippets are sourced from:
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f74e473238aca7b79c08be761d99a0232838ca4c/extensions/markdown-basics/snippets/markdown.code-snippets):  Built-in snippets for the basic markdown syntax.
- [Markdown Snippets extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.markdown-snippets): Snippets for extended markdown syntax.

The *Markdown Snippets* extension is installed automatically along with this extension. Nothing extra is required by you! üôÇ

None of these shortcuts are used by default in VS Code with the exception of `Ctrl+b`. This shortcut is used to "show the sidebar", if you are not editing a markdown file, it will still do this. This may not be to your liking, you are free to assign a different shortcut for it, or others if you wish!

### Rationale

I chose these particular shortcuts because:
1. The '`Ctrl` plus one key' combinations are mostly used already.
1. The '`Ctrl+Shift` plus one additional key' combinations are mostly used already.
1. I wanted to find a consistent and predictable pattern, so opted for combinations that have the same opening sequence.
1. I made an exception for "insert bold" and "insert italic" as most text editors have `ctrl+b` and `ctrl+i` as the shortcuts for these actions, so I thought it best to do the same.

### How to change the shortcuts

You can change the keyboard shortcuts to whatever you want in the *Keyboard Shortcuts UI*.

Unfortunately, VS Code does not show the `args` of a command that would enable you to identify the particular markdown snippet. So, we can't just search for "insert table".

![keyboard shortcuts settings](img/settings.png)

To get the list of markdown shortcuts, search for "insert snippet". It is all the items where the `Command` is "Insert Snippet, and the `When` clause has the condition of `!editorReadonly && editorTextFocus && editorLangId == markdown`. You need to know the current keybinding to find the snippet shortcut you are interested in.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84072) to improve the *Keyboard shortcuts  UI* to make this a better experience. Hopefully, this will happen soon, you can give the issue a üëç to indicate your interest in the implementation of a solution.
