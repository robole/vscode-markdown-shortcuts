> This extension is best used as a source of inspiration for creating your own shortcuts for markdown snippets. It *should* work forever. The project is now closed to contributions - the repo is archived.

The cool thing about snippets is that they can be setup to behave like a wizard and give a guided editing experience. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Adding keyboard shortcuts to snippets can improve your typing efficiency when writing markdown documents. ‚å®Ô∏è‚ú®

![example](img/example.gif)

In the example above, a task list is inserted. You can tab through each task to complete them. If you don't want to edit the snippet at all, or you are done early, just hit `Enter` and the snippet will be finalised. Easy-peasy! üôå

The snippets are sourced from:
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f74e473238aca7b79c08be761d99a0232838ca4c/extensions/markdown-basics/snippets/markdown.code-snippets):  The built-in snippets for the basic markdown syntax.
- [Markdown Snippets extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.markdown-snippets): Snippets for extended markdown syntax.

The *Markdown Snippets* extension is installed automatically along with this extension. Nothing extra is required by you! üôÇ

None of these shortcuts are used by default in VS Code with the exception of `Ctrl+b`. This shortcut is used to "View: Toggle Side Bar Visibility". If you are not editing a markdown file, it will still do this. This may not be to your liking, you are free to assign a different shortcut for it, or others if you wish!

### Rationale

I chose these particular shortcuts because:
1. The '`Ctrl` plus one key' combinations are mostly used already.
1. The '`Ctrl+Shift` plus one additional key' combinations are mostly used already.
1. I wanted to find a consistent and predictable pattern, so opted for combinations that have the same opening sequence.
1. I made an exception for "insert bold" and "insert italic" as most text editors have `ctrl+b` and `ctrl+i` as the shortcuts for these actions, so I thought it best to do the same.

### How to change the shortcuts
